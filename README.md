# Spaceship-Console
This is the space console app, created by the Special Project Team for the first ever student portfolio showcase for the Web Design and Interactive Media program at Humber College

It is a mix of web design, node development and Arduino circuitry.  Its purpose is to randomly show three students on the screen with description (name, title, etc.) on a timed interval.  If one of the buttons on the physical console (Arduino-based) is pressed, three randomly generated students from a filtered category (e.g. designers or developers) is displayed.
